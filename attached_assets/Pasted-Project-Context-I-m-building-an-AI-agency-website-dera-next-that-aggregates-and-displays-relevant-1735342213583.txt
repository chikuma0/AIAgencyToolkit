Project Context:
I'm building an AI agency website (dera-next) that aggregates and displays relevant AI news for SMBs. We're focused on delivering "AI horsepower for distributed era" to SMBs.

Current Stack:
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Basic HackerNews scraper in src/lib/news/scrapers/

Content Priority Strategy:
1. AI for Business Operations (Highest Priority)
   - SMB-focused AI tools and platforms
   - AI automation case studies
   - Cost-effective AI solutions
   - AI productivity tools

2. AI Industry Updates (High Priority)
   - New AI model releases
   - AI pricing changes
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Open-source AI developments

3. Implementation Stories (Medium Priority)
   - SMB success stories with AI
   - AI integration challenges/solutions
   - ROI reports and metrics
   - Best practices

4. General Tech (Lower Priority)
   - Related infrastructure news
   - Security considerations
   - Industry regulations
   - Market trends

Implementation Goals:

1. Supabase Setup (Need to create from scratch):
- Database tables for news items with priority categorization
- Source weighting system
- Content scoring based on SMB/AI relevance
- 6-month retention policy

2. Enhanced News Scraper:
- Content categorization based on our priority system
- SMB/AI relevance scoring
- Filtering mechanism for each priority level
- Multi-source aggregation (starting with HackerNews)

3. News Ticker Component:
- Prioritized display based on content categories
- Smooth transitions between items
- Category-based visual indicators
- Interactive elements for user engagement

Please help me implement this step by step, focusing on:
- Clear explanations for Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- TypeScript type definitions
- Step-by-step terminal commands
- Best practices for each implementation
- Breaking down complex tasks

Current Task: [specific task you want to work on]

Note: I'm relatively new to Next.js and TypeScript, so detailed explanations and smaller steps are appreciated.
